<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Phenolic Resins Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoplastic Phenolic Resin</li><li>Thermosetting Phenolic Resin</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Phenolic resins are a type of synthetic resin that can be classified into two main categories based on their properties and uses: thermoplastic phenolic resin and thermosetting phenolic resin. Thermoplastic phenolic resins can be melted and reformed multiple times due to their linear molecular structure, making them suitable for applications where flexibility is needed. In contrast, thermosetting phenolic resins are cross-linked polymers that undergo a permanent chemical change when cured, making them highly durable and heat-resistant, ideal for use in high-performance applications.</p></p>
