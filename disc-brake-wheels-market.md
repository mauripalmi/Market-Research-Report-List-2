<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Disc Brake Wheels Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tubular Disc Brake Wheel</li><li>Tubeless Disc Brake Wheel</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The disc brake wheels market can be classified into three main types - tubular disc brake wheels, tubeless disc brake wheels, and others. Tubular disc brake wheels have a traditional tubular tire glued directly to the rim for maximum performance. Tubeless disc brake wheels eliminate the need for inner tubes, reducing the risk of flats and allowing for lower tire pressure. The "Others" category encompasses a variety of disc brake wheel designs and technologies that do not fit into the tubular or tubeless categories.</p></p>
