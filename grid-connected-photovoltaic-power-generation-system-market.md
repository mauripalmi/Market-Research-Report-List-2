<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Grid-connected Photovoltaic Power Generation System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>With Battery</li><li>Without Battery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Grid-connected Photovoltaic Power Generation Systems can be categorized into two main types: With Battery and Without Battery. Systems with batteries allow for energy storage, which can be used during periods of low sunlight or power outages. On the other hand, systems without batteries directly feed excess energy back into the grid for a credit or net metering, without the need for storage. Both types offer sustainable and cost-effective energy solutions for residential and commercial applications.</p></p>
