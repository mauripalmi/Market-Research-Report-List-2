<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Melting Point Polypropylene Resin Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>20-30g / 10 min</li><li>30.1-35 g / 10 min</li><li>35.1-100g / 10min</li></ul></p>
<p><p>High melting point polypropylene resin is categorized based on its melt flow rate (MFR) into three main types: -20-30g / 10 min, 30.1-35 g / 10 min, and 35.1-100g / 10min. The MFR indicates the viscosity of the resin, with lower MFR indicating higher viscosity. Resins with MFR -20-30g / 10 min are commonly used in applications requiring a balance of stiffness and impact resistance. 30.1-35 g / 10 min resins are suitable for applications that require a higher flow rate, while 35.1-100g / 10min resins are ideal for thin-walled parts.</p></p>
