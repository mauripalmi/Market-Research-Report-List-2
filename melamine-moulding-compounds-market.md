<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Melamine Moulding Compounds Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Injection Molding</li><li>Compression Molding</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Melamine Moulding Compounds are widely used in two types of markets: Injection Molding and Compression Molding. In Injection Molding, the compound is heated until it becomes fluid and then injected into a mold where it solidifies into the desired shape. This method is ideal for producing large quantities of intricate, detailed parts. Compression Molding involves placing the compound in a heated mold and applying pressure to compress it into the desired shape. This process is best suited for manufacturing larger, simpler parts.</p></p>
