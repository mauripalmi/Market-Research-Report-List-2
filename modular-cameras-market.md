<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Modular Cameras Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CCD</li><li>CMOS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Modular cameras are a type of camera system where individual components can be easily swapped or upgraded. There are two main types of image sensors used in modular cameras: CCD (charge-coupled device) and CMOS (complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor). CCD sensors offer high-quality images with low noise levels, making them ideal for applications requiring high image fidelity. On the other hand, CMOS sensors are more energy-efficient and cost-effective, making them popular for consumer electronics and general-purpose photography. Both sensor types have their own advantages and are widely used in the modular camera market.</p></p>
