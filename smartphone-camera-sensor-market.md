<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Smartphone Camera Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Front-illuminated Sensor</li><li>Backside-illuminated Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Smartphone camera sensors come in two main types: front-illuminated sensors and backside-illuminated sensors. Front-illuminated sensors have a layer of metal on top of the pixels, which can block some light from reaching the sensor, resulting in lower image quality. Backside-illuminated sensors have the wiring behind the pixels, allowing more light to reach the sensor and produce higher quality images, especially in low-light conditions. Both types of sensors are commonly used in smartphones, with backside-illuminated sensors generally considered more advanced and offering better performance.</p></p>
