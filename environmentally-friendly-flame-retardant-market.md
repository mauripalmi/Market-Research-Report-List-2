<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Environmentally Friendly Flame Retardant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Halogen Flame Retardant</li><li>Phosphorus Flame Retardant</li><li>Nitrogen Flame Retardant</li><li>Phosphorus Halogen Flame Retardant</li><li>Phosphorus Nitrogen Flame Retardant</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Environmentally friendly flame retardants are categorized into different types based on their composition and mode of action. Halogen flame retardants contain elements such as chlorine or bromine, which release toxic gases when burned. Phosphorus flame retardants work by forming a protective char layer when exposed to heat, reducing the spread of flames. Nitrogen flame retardants inhibit the combustion process by releasing nitrogen gas. Phosphorus halogen and phosphorus nitrogen flame retardants combine the benefits of both phosphorus and either halogen or nitrogen to provide effective fire protection with reduced environmental impact.</p></p>
