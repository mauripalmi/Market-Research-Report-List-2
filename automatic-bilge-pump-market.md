<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automatic Bilge Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Float Switch</li><li>No Float Switch</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automatic bilge pumps are available in two different types: those with a float switch and those without. Bilge pumps with a float switch are designed to activate and start pumping water out of the boat's hull when the water level rises and reaches the switch. On the other hand, bilge pumps without a float switch rely on sensors to detect the presence of water and turn on automatically. Both types serve the same purpose of preventing water accumulation and damage to the boat.</p></p>
